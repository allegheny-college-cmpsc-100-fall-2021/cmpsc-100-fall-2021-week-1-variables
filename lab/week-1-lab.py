A program that calculates, based on desired "margin" (i.e. space left on either side of a set of pictures), the accurate spacing between pictures on a wall of a given size.
"""

# TODO: Request the various "givens" required for the problem
#       - Use "margin" as the variable name/identifier for the margin on either side

# TODO: Calculate the space between pictures
#       - Use "spacing" as the variable name for the final space between calculation

# Hint -- remove the amount reserved for margin from available space
# Hint -- consider the number of actual gaps between pictures; if there
#         are three pictures, how many gaps are there?

# Leave the bottom statement alone
print(f"\nPictures should be {spacing} feet apart, assuming a {margin} foot space on either side.")
