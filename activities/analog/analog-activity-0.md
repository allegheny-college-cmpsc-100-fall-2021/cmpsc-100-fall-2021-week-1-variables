# Analog Activity 0: Variables

In this activity, we're practicing variables by attempting in a race of sorts. Your instructor will place you in teams that will persist for the remainder of the semester, in which you'll try to achieve as many points as possible in order to qualify for the semester bonus.

This is one game during which you'll earn points toward that bonus.

## Setup

Duration: ~10 minutes

You should ask questions during the "Setup" phase.

1. Elect a team leader. Or appoint one. Or take the position by a combination of cunning, stealth, and force.
2. Develop a team name (v. impt).
3. [At the end of these instructions](#Values) you'll find a list of various "assignments"; the names for these variables should be `YOUR TEAM NAME` followed by an underscore (`_`) and the letter (e.g. `a`). For me, it'd be something like `boss_a` (Team Boss, ftw).
4. On the paper provided to you, write the `expression`s which set up all of the variables on the list. When your team is finished with this, have the team leader signal to the instructor (e.g. `boss_a = 3`, "boss_a gets 3."). Each should receive its own line.

Once these steps are completed, move on to the rules.

## Playing the game

Duration: ~30 minutes

To achieve a collective sum of as close to `100` as possible. Your team may exceed or have a total less than this number. Each transaction should be listed on its own line. There are multiple rounds to this game during which you will attempt the same task with varying constraints:

1. You are restricted to only `10` "moves" (instructions) -- of which you must use all `10`
2. You are restricted to `5.5` minutes
3. You are restricted to using each variable once in all statements
4. (If time allows) You can only use one operation (e.g. only `*=`)
5. (If time allows) You may use up to `10` instructions

Teams will be awarded points by ranking the team with the closest total to the team with the farthest total for each round. Points will be added up to achieve a total for the exercise.

## Rules

1. You must write each "move" as a correct expression (i.e. `boss_a -= boss_c`)
2. Your team can only use the materials given to you (i.e. no additional numbers beyond those given you may be used; e.g. you can't multiply something by magically by `10`).
3. At the end of the time, elect a member to be a scribe, using a different scribe for each round of the game. This scribe will write the instruction set used to solve the round on the whiteboard.

## Scoring

* Before scoring, the instructor will come around and look at all team logs. If there are any invalid expressions, anything _below and including_ the invalid expression no longer applies. (Everything before will still contribute.)
* To score the activity:
  * The group must tally the results of their valid `expression`s.
  * The resulting tally is the final value of the individual member's identifying name.
  * The group must, using a combination of arithmetic operators, attempt to get as close to `100` as possible, using each identifier _at least one time_.

## Additional reminders and guidelines

* Each team's value and letter combinations are the same.
* All instructions must be written on a separate line.
* The instructor will validate all logs before scoring. You may not begin scoring before the instructor has done so.
* You are allowed time to strategize before the game begins.
* You must complete the activity [reflection](writing/reflection.md) to receive full credit.

## Debrief

Duration: ~15 minutes

The course will reconvene as a whole to discuss conclusions drawn or arising from the activity.
